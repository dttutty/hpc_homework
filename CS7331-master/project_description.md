   * Apply ML to predict 
       * some aspect of performance (cache behavior) 
	   * optimization parameters 
	   * optimization set 
	   * optimization sequence 
   * Implement a simple optimization in LLVM 
   * Do a performance study with a benchmark suite 
   * Select an application and optimize using different tools and methods
